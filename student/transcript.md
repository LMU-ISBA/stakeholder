## Meeting Transcript

**Consultant:**
On the production side, we design and manufacture our products, get them distributed, and place them in use worldwide. When I joined a few months back, the stakeholder and I began discussing support challenges. Our Support Manager leads that effort.

Once our gear is in the field, customers contact us in all kinds of ways. Some ask about setup (“how do I connect this?”), others want advanced functions, and longtime users ask about expansions or report errors.

That means we’re handling a flood of incoming questions while being expected to respond quickly and thoroughly. Our users range from students in dorm rooms to top-tier recording studios.

The two big goals are: cut down on repeated questions, and shorten the time it takes to respond. We’ve started digging into the data, and we think most issues may come from a few products. The Duet 3, one of our most popular products, receives a considerable number of support requests. For example, South Korea is generating a very high volume of inquiries for one particular desktop model.

---

**Support Manager:**
Right. Our international service data showed that South Korea led in support tickets for that model.

We’ve also been experimenting with ChatGPT as a companion tool for our agents—mainly for chat and email responses. Phone calls are rare. We’re trying to strengthen our self-help knowledge base, but we’re just learning.

All requests flow through HubSpot: web form, support email, and live chat during certain hours. Phone support is only for special cases. HubSpot also powers our knowledge base, and we’ve been using some of its built-in automation.

---

**Faculty Member:**
Good context. What’s your timing expectation?

---

**Consultant:**
We could start right away. The sooner the better.

---

**Faculty Member:**
That helps. Graduate projects usually run in summer, undergrads during the school year. What you’re describing sounds like an AI-based support agent.

---

**Consultant:**
Yes, that’s the direction we’re aiming for.

---

**Support Manager:**
Agreed. Training an AI agent on company data to handle customer questions is the future. We’ve tried, but results are inconsistent. That’s why we’re interested in guidance.

---

**Faculty Member:**
So you’re already using HubSpot’s chatbot?

---

**Support Manager:**
Yes, but it’s step-based (“chat flows”). It doesn’t handle open-ended questions.

---

**Faculty Member:**
Got it. The real issue is too many tickets and not enough staff to keep up. What metric matters most?

---

**Support Manager:**
Our SLA is one business day. Mondays are the toughest since we don’t work weekends. Improving speed and satisfaction is key.

---

**Consultant:**
Exactly. Speed plus quality. Some cases require human expertise, but many could be automated. Ideally, we’d reduce response time, cut back-and-forth, and make more of the process self-service.

---

**Support Manager:**
And honestly, we may not be using HubSpot to its full potential.

---

**Faculty Member:**
How do you currently prioritize tickets?

---

**Support Manager:**
Most tickets are from end users, both domestic and international. We collect OS and product info upfront, but all tickets land in a shared inbox. We generally work First-In, First-Out. Tickets nearing SLA violation are flagged and get attention first.

---

**Consultant:**
If we analyzed by product, we’d likely see patterns. A few models may generate the majority of requests. We could identify common issues and automate those.

---

**Faculty Member:**
That’s the 80/20 principle—tackle the few issues that cause most of the work.

---

**Support Manager:**
We’ve started tagging tickets, but inconsistently. Needs improvement.

---

**Faculty Member:**
Do you use pre-written responses?

---

**Support Manager:**
Yes, heavily.

---

**Faculty Member:**
Other companies add sentiment analysis and account value into prioritization—so important or upset clients move up in the queue.

---

**Support Manager:**
We don’t do that yet. We treat everyone equally.

---

**Consultant:**
Which means a \$500 customer is treated the same as a \$10,000 customer.

---

**Faculty Member:**
Exactly. Prioritization is as much strategy as technology.

---

**Consultant:**
This conversation only started a few weeks ago when the stakeholder asked me for project ideas.

---

**Faculty Member:**
Good timing. Start small with quick wins, then scale.

---

**Support Manager:**
We’ve tried, but outside experience would help us move faster.

---

**Faculty Member:**
If we can free up some of your team’s time to think strategically, that’s a big win.

---

**Consultant:**
Even half an hour per person per day would make a difference.

---

**Faculty Member:**
This could become multiple projects. Students usually start with requirements and proposals, then build in spring. If you brought in an intern now, they could start sooner and continue into the capstone.

---

**Consultant:**
That would be ideal. Spring feels distant—we’d like to make progress sooner.

---

**Faculty Member:**
We can connect you to recent grads open to internships. If you fund one, they’ll have faculty mentors.

---

**Support Manager:**
We’ve paid interns before. That’s fine.

---

**Faculty Member:**
Great. First steps for them would be:

1. Secure data access.
2. Clean and explore the data.
3. Generate insights and test automation.

---

**Consultant:**
So the end goal is to analyze ticket data, reduce volume, and build automation like chatbots?

---

**Faculty Member:**
Yes. Likely starting with your knowledge base.

---
**Consultant:**
Alright, let me pull this together. The core problem is that our support team is drowning in tickets — a lot of them are repeat questions, and it slows us down. What we want is faster responses, fewer back-and-forths, and more customers finding answers on their own.

The plan we’ve sketched out is pretty clear: start by cleaning and analyzing the ticket data, figure out which products and issues are driving most of the volume, and then build automation around those. In the short term, that probably means improving the knowledge base and training a chatbot so it can handle more cases — if it’s at 10% deflection today, let’s aim for 20–25% by spring.

An intern could kick things off right away, with faculty guidance, and we’d keep building toward bigger automation projects as we go. That gives us both some quick wins and a longer-term direction. Sound good?
