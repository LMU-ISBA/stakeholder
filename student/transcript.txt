On the production side, we design and manufacture our products, get them distributed, and place them in use worldwide. When I joined a few months back to provide guidance, Anna and I began discussing support challenges. Our Support Manager leads that effort.

Once our gear is in the field, customers contact us in all kinds of ways. Some ask about setup—“how do I connect this?”—others want to explore advanced functions, and longtime users often ask about expansions or report errors.

That means we’re handling a flood of incoming questions while being expected to respond quickly and thoroughly. Our users range from students in dorm rooms to top-tier recording studios.

The two big goals are: cut down on repeated questions, and shorten the time it takes to respond. We've just started digging into the data, and we think most issues may come from a few products. The Duet 3, one of our most popular products, receives a considerable number of support requests. For example, we found that South Korea was generating an especially high volume of inquiries for one particular desktop model.

Support Manager:
Right, our international service data showed that South Korea led in support tickets for that model.

Consultant:
Exactly. So when Anna asked about potential projects, I thought this could be a strong candidate—combining data gathering, cleaning, analysis, and possibly AI integration. We’re still very new to this space. Support Manager, anything to add?

Support Manager:
We’ve been experimenting with ChatGPT as a companion tool for our agents—mainly for chat and email responses. Phone calls are rare. We’re also trying to strengthen our self-help knowledge base on the website. But we’re just learning, so external input would be a big help.

Consultant:
Can you explain how requests actually reach your team?

Support Manager:
Sure. Everything goes through HubSpot. We have a web form, a general support email, and a live chat window during certain hours. Phone support is limited to special cases. All those channels feed into HubSpot, which also powers our knowledge base. HubSpot itself has some built-in automation and learning features we’ve been using.

Consultant:
And beyond that, as Greg mentioned earlier, we are capturing customer information—including purchases—but we aren’t really using it for marketing or follow-up sales.

Anyway, let me pause. How do you want to continue?

Faculty Member:
Quick question first—what’s your timing expectation?

Consultant:
We could start right away. Nothing prevents us from moving quickly. The sooner the better.

Faculty Member:
That helps. Graduate projects usually run in summer, undergrads do theirs during the school year, and sometimes faculty get involved if it’s research-oriented. What you’re describing sounds like an AI-based support agent.

Consultant:
Yes, that’s broadly what we’re aiming for.

Support Manager:
Agreed. That’s where the industry is headed—training an agent on company data so it can handle customer questions. I’ve tried it, but results are inconsistent. Still, that’s the future we’d like.

Faculty:
So you’re already using HubSpot’s chatbot on the site?

Support Manager:
Yes. It’s HubSpot’s “chat flow” tool, which is step-based. We recently expanded it across the site.

Faculty:
But it doesn’t handle open-ended questions?

Support Manager:
Correct. It’s structured, not free-form.

Faculty:
So the real issue is too many tickets and not enough staff to keep up. What metric matters most to you?

Support Manager:
Our service-level agreement is one business day. Mondays are tough since we don’t work weekends. Improving speed and satisfaction is key.

Consultant:
Right. Speed plus quality. Sometimes one response solves it, other times it takes back-and-forth. Our equipment is complex, so some issues require human expertise, but many could be automated. Ideally, we’d reduce time, cut interactions, and make more of the process self-service.

Support Manager:
And honestly, we might not be leveraging HubSpot fully. Advice from outside would help.

Faculty:
When tickets come in, how do you decide which ones to tackle first?

Support Manager:
Most are from end users, both domestic and international. We collect OS and product info upfront, but after that, they land in a shared inbox. We generally handle them First-In, First-Out.

Consultant:
We don’t really prioritize by customer type or product at this point.

Support Manager:
Exactly. Everyone works from the same pool. Tickets nearing SLA violation are flagged, so those get attention first.

Consultant:
If we analyzed the data by product, we’d probably see patterns. For example, one model might generate the bulk of requests. We could identify common issues and automate them.

Faculty:
That’s where the 80/20 principle applies—tackle the few issues that create most of the workload.

Consultant:
Exactly. Like emergency room triage—serious cases need faster response. But we need data in better shape to do that.

Support Manager:
We’ve started tagging tickets, but it’s inconsistent. Needs improvement.

Consultant:
Yes. We have the raw data, but it’s not structured well enough for analysis.

Faculty:
Do you use pre-written responses?

Support Manager:
Yes, heavily.

Faculty:
Good. I’ve seen other support teams add sentiment analysis and account value into prioritization. That way, an important or upset client gets moved up.

Support Manager:
That’s new for us. We treat everyone equally, regardless of purchase size or tone.

Consultant:
So someone who spent $500 is treated the same as someone who spent $10,000.

Faculty:
Exactly. Prioritization is as much strategy as it is technology.

Consultant:
And this discussion only started a couple of weeks ago, when Anna asked me about project ideas.

Faculty:
Good timing then. Start small with quick wins, then scale up.

Support Manager:
We’ve tried to think that way, but outside experience would be helpful.

Faculty:
And I know you’re swamped. If we can free up some of your time to think strategically, that’s a big win.

Consultant:
Even half an hour per person each day would be huge.

Faculty Member:
This could break into multiple projects. Greg, could this fit into student capstones?

Faculty:
Yes. Students first gather requirements and draft proposals, then build in spring. But if you brought in an intern now, they could start right away and continue into the capstone.

Consultant:
That would be ideal. Spring feels distant—we’d like to make progress sooner.

Faculty Member:
Our recent grads did similar projects. Some may be open to internships. If you’re willing to fund one, we can connect you.

Support Manager:
We’ve paid interns before. That’s fine.

Faculty:
Great. We encourage pairing internships with capstones so students get both practical and academic support.

Consultant:
Okay. What’s typical for workload and pay?

Faculty:
Depends on the company.

Consultant:
Fair enough. If we hired someone now, what would they start with?

Faculty:
Step one: secure data access. Step two: clean and explore it. Step three: generate insights and test automation.

Consultant:
And if they don’t have the technical skills yet?

Faculty:
They’ll learn. Faculty will mentor them. That’s part of the capstone.

Consultant:
So the end goal is to analyze ticket data, find ways to cut volume, and build automation like chatbots?

Faculty:
Exactly. Likely starting with your knowledge base.

Consultant:
And interns get mentors from LMU?

Faculty:
Yes. We create a PRD outlining stakeholders, success metrics, and a roadmap.

Consultant:
Good. I’ll need that before pitching this internally—I want one strong presentation to leadership.

Faculty:
Understood. We can draft a plan quickly from this discussion.

Consultant:
Excellent. For timeline: by spring, I’d like the data cleaned, Pareto analysis by product done, and some chatbot automation in place. If bots currently answer 10% of tickets, maybe we raise that to 20–25%. Does that sound achievable?

Faculty:
Yes, that’s realistic.
