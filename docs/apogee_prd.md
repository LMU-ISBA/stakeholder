* Opening the widget shows a friendly welcome, 2–4 Duet 3 suggested prompts, a privacy disclaimer, and a note that escalation is available.

* A brief first-time tooltip explains: “Ask a question or choose a prompt. You can escalate to a human at any time.”

**Core Experience**

* Step 1: User opens the chat and types a question or selects a suggested prompt.

  * Keep input box visible with placeholder text (“Ask about Duet 3 setup, firmware, drivers, or troubleshooting…”).

  * Validate user input for harmful content; show a respectful warning if blocked.

  * Show typing indicator; aim for sub-3s first response; display message timestamp.

  * Use bulleted steps and concise language tailored to Duet 3 scenarios.

  * Include “Was this helpful?” micro-feedback buttons.

  * Provide secondary suggestions based on intent (“Related: No input signal, USB power, Apogee Control 2 install”).

* Step 3: If unclear intent, bot asks a clarifying question (e.g., “Mac, Windows, or iPad?” “Which DAW: Logic, Pro Tools, Ableton, others?”).

  * Present as selectable options to reduce typing.

  * Time out after 60s and nudge with a gentle reminder.

* Step 4: Guided troubleshooting flow (when relevant).

  * Present step-by-step checks with checkboxes (“Done,” “It didn’t work”).

  * Examples: USB-C port/cable checks, driver installation steps (Windows), security/privacy prompts (macOS), sample rate mismatch, phantom power for condenser mics, firmware update via Apogee Control 2.

  * On failure, prefill escalation modal with gathered details.

* Step 5: Escalation flow.

  * If business hours: offer live agent handoff or ticket creation with ETA.

  * After hours: collect email/phone; confirm ticket creation and provide reference ID.

  * Attach full transcript and user device/OS/DAW info if consented.

* Step 6: Post-interaction wrap-up.

  * Request CSAT rating with optional text feedback.

  * Offer to email a copy of the steps or link to saved article.

## Narrative

Alex is a producer who just unboxed a Duet 3 and connects it to a Windows 11 laptop. In Ableton Live, there’s no input signal, and Windows shows a generic USB audio device. Alex opens the Apogee Digital Duet 3 support page and clicks the “Help” button.

The chatbot greets Alex with suggestions: “Install Windows driver,” “Update firmware,” “No sound,” and “Set sample rate.” Alex types, “Windows doesn’t see Duet 3.” The bot replies instantly with a clear checklist: confirm USB-C power and cable, install the official Windows driver, allow driver in security settings, reboot, then update firmware via Apogee Control 2. It includes links to the Duet 3 driver and user guide with citations. When the device is recognized but still silent in the DAW, the bot asks clarifying questions and guides Alex to select the ASIO driver, set sample rate, enable inputs, and verify phantom power for a condenser mic.

After a few steps, Alex gets signal. The bot offers to email the steps. For a separate question about registering the product and transferring an Apogee FX plugin license, Alex taps “Escalate.” With one click, the conversation, OS details, driver version, and DAW info flow to an Apogee agent, who joins with full context and resolves the registration issue in minutes.

Over the week, the bot handles hundreds of Duet 3 questions—drivers, firmware, iPad connectivity, direct monitoring, and accessory compatibility—with citations and guided troubleshooting. Customers get answers fast, and agents focus on complex work. The support manager opens the dashboard: containment is above target, CSAT is strong, and unresolved topics highlight content gaps the team can fix. Apogee meets SLAs, and support costs stay stable despite growing Duet 3 adoption.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* Front-End

  * Lightweight embeddable widget (iframe or script injection) with Apogee theme configuration.

  * Accessibility-compliant UI components and offline-safe message queue.

* Back-End

  * Chat orchestration service for intent detection, retrieval, and response generation focused on Duet 3 topics.

  * Retrieval layer over approved Duet 3 knowledge sources with ranking and citation mapping.

  * Ticketing connector service for escalation and transcript packaging to Apogee’s support platform.

  * Analytics pipeline for event ingestion, redaction, and reporting.

* Data Models

  * Conversation, Message, Intent, Article, Feedback, Ticket, UserSession.

* Safety & Guardrails

  * Content filters, restricted-topic policies, allowlist of Duet 3 knowledge domains; enforce Duet 3-only scope at launch.

### Integration Points

* Knowledge Sources: Apogee Digital Help Center, Duet 3 user guide and quick start, release notes, Apogee Control 2 documentation (via sitemap, API, or feed).

* Ticketing/CRM: Integration with Apogee’s primary support platform (e.g., queue assignment, ticket creation, attachments).

* Authentication: Optional session identification via Apogee account portal (token or cookie-based).

* Observability: Logging, metrics, alerting systems; uptime monitoring.

* Analytics: Existing analytics or CDP for event forwarding.

### Data Storage & Privacy

* Data Flow

  * User messages processed by orchestration; retrieval limited to approved Duet 3 sources.

  * Transcripts stored with PII redaction; linked to ticket IDs on escalation.

* Storage Strategy

  * Encrypted at rest and in transit; separate environments for staging/production.

  * Configurable data retention (e.g., 90 days) and regional storage if needed.

* Compliance

  * GDPR/CCPA readiness: user consent, data deletion requests, purpose limitation.

  * Vendor controls: disable training on customer data where applicable; DPA in place.

### Scalability & Performance

* Expected Load: Initial 500–2,000 daily Duet 3 sessions; burst handling to 100 concurrent chats.

* Horizontal scaling of stateless services; caching for frequent Duet 3 queries.

* Circuit breakers and graceful degradation to keyword search when upstreams degrade.

* Backoff/retry strategies for ticketing APIs; queueing for after-hours escalations.

### Potential Challenges

* Hallucinations: Mitigate via strict Duet 3-only retrieval with citations and low-confidence fallbacks.

* Knowledge Freshness: Establish re-index cadence and invalidation on Duet 3 content updates and new firmware releases.

* Integration Limits: Handle ticketing rate limits and transient failures safely.

* Privacy: Ensuring PII redaction accuracy and honoring user consent.

* Multilingual Nuances: Out-of-scope for launch; plan for phased rollout once Duet 3 content is ready.
