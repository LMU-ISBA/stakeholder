# Phase 2: Discovery Meeting Preparation (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Build on Phase 1 research to create strategic stakeholder discovery framework. Validate assumptions and fill research gaps through targeted questions.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 1: Research](./phase1_research.md) - Leverage research insights, assumptions, and identified gaps to inform discovery strategy

---

## Step 1: Research Context Preparation (3 minutes)

**Go back to your Phase 1 research conversation and type:**
```
I need to prepare for a discovery meeting preparation. Create a concise summary of our research that I can use as context for my next AI collaboration. Include:

1. **Key Company Insights:** Most important findings about Apogee Digital's business, customers, and market position
2. **Customer Service Challenges:** Main support issues and pain points we identified  
3. **Critical Assumptions:** The assumptions we identified that need stakeholder validation
4. **Research Gaps:** Specific questions/areas where we need more information from stakeholders
5. **Stakeholder Concerns:** Potential resistance or concerns about automation we should address

Format this as a structured summary I can copy and paste as context for my discovery planning.
```

**Your Action:** Copy the AI-generated structured summary for use in Step 2.

**Learning Point:** Having AI synthesize your previous work creates more comprehensive context than manual copy/paste efforts.

## Step 2: Research-Informed Discovery Strategy (12 minutes)

### Step 2A: Strategic Meeting Agenda Creation (4 minutes)
**Use the structured research summary to create a meeting framework. Type:**
```
ROLE: You are a senior business consultant preparing for a critical stakeholder discovery meeting.

CONTEXT: [Paste the structured research summary from Step 1 here]

TASK: Create a strategic discovery meeting agenda that:
1. Builds stakeholder buy-in while addressing automation concerns (job security, process changes)
2. Validates key assumptions from our research
3. Uncovers which products/areas drive the most support volume and complexity
4. Gathers evidence needed for presidential approval business case

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Strategic meeting agenda for 60-minute stakeholder session
- Stakeholder management strategy for potential concerns or resistance
- Success criteria and key information that must be gathered
```

### Step 2B: Discovery Questions Development (5 minutes)
**Building on the meeting agenda, develop targeted questions. Type:**
```
ROLE: You are a senior business consultant developing discovery questions for stakeholder interviews.

CONTEXT: [Use the same research summary from Step 2A]

TASK: Create 15 prioritized discovery questions organized by category that:
1. Validate the key assumptions identified in my research analysis
2. Fill the specific research gaps we identified
3. Uncover product-specific pain points and quantifiable business impact
4. Support the meeting agenda we just created

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- 15 prioritized discovery questions organized by category (validation, gap-filling, strategic insights)
- Transition strategy to analysis phase
```

### Step 2C: Question Enhancement (3 minutes)
**Based on the discovery questions from Step 2B, type:**
```
Review the discovery questions you just created. Suggest 3-5 specific improvements to make them more effective at uncovering the strategic insights we need. Focus on question phrasing that will reveal product-specific pain points and quantifiable business impact.
```

**Your Action:** Manually refine 3-5 questions based on AI suggestions to make them more precise and strategic.

**Learning Point:** Building on previous research creates more strategic, targeted discovery rather than starting from scratch

## Step 3: Stakeholder Simulation Practice (5 minutes)
**Practice your refined discovery questions with realistic stakeholder scenarios. Type:**
```
ROLE: You are roleplaying as an Apogee Digital support team lead who is concerned about how automation might affect your team and processes.

CONTEXT: Based on the research insights and discovery framework we developed, you understand this is about customer service automation for a professional audio equipment company. You have some concerns about job security and process changes, but you also see potential benefits.

TASK: Present 3 different stakeholder personality scenarios (optimistic, realistic, challenging) and let me choose which one to practice with. Then roleplay that selected scenario by responding to my discovery questions one at a time, making realistic comments, and waiting for my follow-up responses to simulate an actual discovery meeting conversation flow.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Brief description of all 3 stakeholder personality types for selection
- After I choose, respond to ONE question at a time with realistic stakeholder comments
- Wait for my follow-up before continuing the conversation
- Provide coaching feedback only at the end of our practice session
```

**Learning Point:** Practice with realistic stakeholder responses prepares you for the actual discovery conversation and helps refine your questioning approach.

**Phase 2 Deliverable:** Research-informed discovery strategy with validated questions and stakeholder simulation experience

**Next Step:** Proceed to [Phase 3: Strategic Analysis & PRD](./phase3_analysis.md) where you'll analyze the actual stakeholder transcript to make strategic decisions.
