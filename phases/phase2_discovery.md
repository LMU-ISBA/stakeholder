# Phase 2: Discovery Meeting Preparation (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Build on Phase 1 research to create strategic stakeholder discovery framework. Validate assumptions and fill research gaps through targeted questions.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 1: Research](./phase1_research.md) - Leverage research insights, assumptions, and identified gaps to inform discovery strategy

---

## Step 1: Research Context Preparation (3 minutes)

**Go back to your Phase 1 research conversation and type:**
```
I need to prepare for a discovery meeting preparation. Create a concise summary of our research that I can use as context for my next AI collaboration. Include:

1. **Key Company Insights:** Most important findings about Apogee Digital's business, customers, and market position
2. **Customer Service Challenges:** Main support issues and pain points we identified  
3. **Critical Assumptions:** The assumptions we identified that need stakeholder validation
4. **Research Gaps:** Specific questions/areas where we need more information from stakeholders
5. **Stakeholder Concerns:** Potential resistance or concerns about automation we should address

Format this as a structured summary I can copy and paste as context for my discovery planning.
```

**Your Action:** Copy the AI-generated structured summary for use in Step 2.

**Learning Point:** Having AI synthesize your previous work creates more comprehensive context than manual copy/paste efforts.

## Step 2: Research-Informed Discovery Strategy (9 minutes)

**Use the structured research summary to create comprehensive discovery approach. Type:**
```
ROLE: You are a senior business consultant preparing for a critical stakeholder discovery meeting.

CONTEXT: [Paste the structured research summary from Step 1 here]

TASK: Create a strategic discovery meeting framework that:
1. Validates the key assumptions identified in my research analysis
2. Fills the specific research gaps we identified
3. Uncovers which products/areas drive the most support volume and complexity
4. Builds stakeholder buy-in while addressing automation concerns (job security, process changes)
5. Gathers evidence needed for presidential approval business case

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Strategic meeting agenda for 60-minute stakeholder session
- 15 prioritized discovery questions organized by category (validation, gap-filling, strategic insights)
- Stakeholder management strategy for potential concerns or resistance
- Success criteria and key information that must be gathered
- Transition strategy to analysis phase
```

**Learning Point:** Building on previous research creates more strategic, targeted discovery rather than starting from scratch

## Step 3: Discovery Question Refinement (8 minutes)

### Step 3A: Question Enhancement (3 minutes)
**Based on the comprehensive framework from Step 2, type:**
```
Review the discovery questions you just created. Suggest 3-5 specific improvements to make them more effective at uncovering the strategic insights we need. Focus on question phrasing that will reveal product-specific pain points and quantifiable business impact.
```

**Your Action:** Manually refine 3-5 questions based on AI suggestions to make them more precise and strategic.

### Step 3B: Stakeholder Simulation Practice (5 minutes)
**Practice your refined discovery questions with realistic stakeholder scenarios. Type:**
```
ROLE: You are roleplaying as an Apogee Digital support team lead who is concerned about how automation might affect your team and processes.

CONTEXT: Based on the research insights and discovery framework we developed, you understand this is about customer service automation for a professional audio equipment company. You have some concerns about job security and process changes, but you also see potential benefits.

TASK: Roleplay 3 different meeting scenarios (optimistic, realistic, challenging stakeholder personalities) and let me practice my refined discovery questions with each type. Give me realistic responses that would help me practice handling different stakeholder dynamics.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Brief setup for each stakeholder personality type
- Realistic responses to my discovery questions
- Coaching feedback on my questioning technique and follow-up opportunities
```

**Learning Point:** Practice with realistic stakeholder responses prepares you for the actual discovery conversation and helps refine your questioning approach.

**Phase 2 Deliverable:** Research-informed discovery strategy with validated questions and stakeholder simulation experience

**Next Step:** Proceed to [Phase 3: Strategic Analysis & PRD](./phase3_analysis.md) where you'll analyze the actual stakeholder transcript to make strategic decisions.
