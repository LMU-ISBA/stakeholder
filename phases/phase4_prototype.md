# Phase 4: Targeted Prototype Development (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Build focused prototype directly from the PRD created in Phase 3. Create comprehensive prompt for no-code builder that translates strategic analysis into demonstrable proof-of-concept.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 3: Analysis](./phase3_analysis.md) - Use PRD and strategic analysis to build targeted solution

---

## Step 1: PRD-to-Prototype Strategy (8 minutes)

### Step 1A: AI-Generated Prototype Requirements Framework (8 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Create a structured ROLE CONTEXT TASKS OUTPUT FORMAT prompt for analyzing my PRD to extract comprehensive prototype requirements. The prompt should help me translate my strategic analysis into concrete design specifications that include conversation flows, customer scenarios, executive demonstration features, and technical constraints.
```

**AI will generate an RCTO framework like:**
```
ROLE: [What type of prototype design expertise do we need?]

CONTEXT: [What should AI understand about the PRD and prototype objectives?]

TASK: [What specific elements need to be extracted from the PRD?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [How should the prototype requirements be structured?]
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt with your Phase 3 PRD to create comprehensive prototype specifications.**

**Your Action:** Copy your Phase 3 PRD content and use it with the RCTO prompt to get targeted prototype requirements based on strategic analysis

## Step 2: Comprehensive No-Code Builder Prompt Creation (14 minutes)

### Step 2A: Platform-Optimized Prompt Development (14 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Create a structured ROLE CONTEXT TASKS OUTPUT FORMAT prompt for building a no-code prototype (lovable.dev, bolt.new, v0.app, or replit.com) based on my prototype requirements. The prompt should translate my strategic analysis into executable design specifications for professional executive demonstration.
```

**AI will generate an RCTO framework like:**
```
ROLE: [What type of no-code development expertise do we need?]

CONTEXT: [What should the platform understand about the business case and prototype objectives?]

TASK: [What specific prototype features and functionality need to be built?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [How should the prototype be structured and presented?]
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt on your chosen no-code platform to build the prototype.**

**AI will create a comprehensive, platform-ready prompt that translates your strategic work into executable design specifications**

## Step 3: Prototype Execution and Refinement (8 minutes)

### Step 3A: Prototype Execution (5 minutes)
**Use the comprehensive prompt created in Step 2A on your chosen no-code platform:**

**Platform Recommendations:**
- **lovable.dev**: Full-stack web application development with AI assistance
- **bolt.new**: Instant web app prototyping with modern frameworks  
- **v0.app**: AI-powered UI component and interface generation
- **replit.com**: Collaborative coding environment with instant deployment

**Execute the build using your AI-generated prompt**

### Step 3B: Prototype Validation and Refinement (3 minutes)
**After initial prototype generation, type:**
```
Create a structured ROLE CONTEXT TASKS OUTPUT FORMAT prompt for creating a manual validation checklist for my prototype. I will open the prototype in a browser and need a systematic checklist to evaluate whether it effectively demonstrates the business value and supports my strategic business case from the PRD.
```

**AI will generate an RCTO framework like:**
```
ROLE: [What type of prototype evaluation expertise do we need?]

CONTEXT: [What should AI understand about the PRD requirements and manual validation process?]

TASK: [What specific validation checklist items should be created?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [How should the checklist be structured for manual browser testing?]
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt to create your validation checklist.**

**Your Action:** Open your prototype in a browser and use the checklist to manually validate it, then make targeted refinements based on the assessment

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If your no-code platform has issues, add this to your prompt: *"Think harder about this request and reason through the technical requirements step by step."*

**Phase 4 Deliverable:** Static prototype screens ready for integration into Phase 5 pitch deck presentation

**Next Step:** Proceed to [Phase 5: Pitch Deck Creation](./phase5_pitch.md) where you'll integrate all your work into a compelling presidential presentation.
