# Phase 4: Targeted Prototype Development (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Build focused prototype for the specific product area identified in Phase 3. Create realistic conversation flows using actual product knowledge base content. Demonstrate proof-of-concept approach.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 3: Analysis](./phase3_analysis.md) - Use product focus decision and validation research to build targeted solution

---

## Step 1: Product-Specific Research Deep Dive (10 minutes)

### Step 1A: Knowledge Base Analysis (5 minutes)
**Based on your Phase 3 product focus decision, research the specific product's support resources:**

**For example, if you identified a specific product, navigate to its knowledge base or support documentation**

**Type:**
```
I've identified [PRODUCT NAME] as our prototype focus based on stakeholder insights. Help me analyze the support documentation and knowledge base for this product to understand:
1. Most common customer issues and questions
2. Complexity patterns in the support content
3. Types of issues that could be automated vs. need human expertise
4. Conversation flow opportunities for chatbot interactions
```

**Action:** Browse the product's knowledge base and documentation to understand support complexity

### Step 1B: Automation Opportunity Assessment (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on the [PRODUCT] knowledge base I just reviewed, help me identify the top 3 conversation flows that would be most suitable for chatbot automation. Consider: frequency of issues, availability of clear answers, and ability to guide customers through solutions step-by-step.
```

**Expected Response:** Specific conversation flow recommendations based on actual product support content

## Step 2: Conversation Flow Design (12 minutes)

### Step 2A: AI-Assisted Flow Architecture (7 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Help me design detailed conversation flows for [PRODUCT] customer support automation. I want to focus on the top conversation flows we identified. For each flow, help me create:
1. Entry points (how customers might express this need)
2. Information gathering questions 
3. Decision tree logic based on customer responses
4. Resolution paths using actual knowledge base content
5. Escalation triggers for human handoff

Let's start with the first flow: [MOST COMMON ISSUE IDENTIFIED]
```

**AI will help create realistic conversation flows using actual product complexity**

### Step 2B: Content Integration Strategy (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
For these conversation flows, how should we integrate the existing [PRODUCT] knowledge base content? Help me design a strategy that uses the actual support articles and documentation as chatbot responses while maintaining conversational flow.
```

**Expected Response:** Strategy for leveraging existing content in automated conversations

## Step 3: Prototype Creation (8 minutes)

### Step 3A: Platform Selection with AI Guidance (3 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on our [PRODUCT] conversation flows and the need to demonstrate this to executives, help me choose the best prototyping platform from these options: lovable.dev, bolt.new, v0.app, or replit.com. Consider: ease of development, demonstration capabilities, realistic chat interface creation, and executive presentation value.
```

**Platform options:**
- **lovable.dev**: Full-stack web application development with AI assistance
- **bolt.new**: Instant web app prototyping with modern frameworks
- **v0.app**: AI-powered UI component and interface generation
- **replit.com**: Collaborative coding environment with instant deployment

### Step 3B: Rapid Prototype Development (5 minutes)
**First, create a comprehensive prompt for your no-code platform. Type:**
```
I need to create a detailed prompt for [chosen platform] to build a customer service chatbot UI prototype with static screens. Based on our [PRODUCT] conversation flows and business requirements, help me write a comprehensive prompt that includes:

1. Project context: customer service chatbot demonstration for executives
2. UI requirements: modern chat interface with message bubbles and input fields
3. Screen flow requirements: static screens showing our conversation flow with pre-written responses
4. Visual design: professional appearance suitable for business presentation
5. User interaction: click-through navigation between conversation steps (no backend/database needed)
6. Content specifications: realistic customer inputs and knowledge base responses we identified

Make this prompt detailed enough that the no-code platform can generate static prototype screens that demonstrate our conversation flow visually for executive presentation. Focus on UI mockups, not functional chat logic.
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt on your chosen platform to create:**

**Key Static Screens to Build:**
- Screen 1: Initial customer inquiry (with realistic customer message)
- Screen 2: Bot response asking clarifying questions
- Screen 3: Customer provides additional details
- Screen 4: Bot delivers knowledge base solution with next steps
- Screen 5: Resolution confirmation or escalation handoff

**Static Content to Include:**
- Pre-written realistic customer messages based on product research
- Pre-written bot responses using actual knowledge base content
- Visual conversation flow that can be clicked through step-by-step
- Professional chat interface design suitable for executive demonstration

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If your no-code platform throws errors or has trouble generating your prototype, try rewriting your prompt with this addition: *"Think harder about this request and reason through the technical requirements step by step."* This can trigger more sophisticated reasoning and often resolves complex generation issues.

**Focus on:** Visual demonstration of one complete conversation that executives can click through to see the automation in action

**Phase 4 Deliverable:** Static prototype screens ready for integration into Phase 5 pitch deck presentation

**Next Step:** Proceed to [Phase 5: Pitch Deck Creation](./phase5_pitch.md) where you'll integrate all your work into a compelling presidential presentation.
