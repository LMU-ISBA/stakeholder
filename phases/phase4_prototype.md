# Phase 4: Targeted Prototype Development (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Build focused prototype directly from the PRD created in Phase 3. Create comprehensive prompt for no-code builder that translates strategic analysis into demonstrable proof-of-concept.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 3: Analysis](./phase3_analysis.md) - Use PRD and strategic analysis to build targeted solution

---

## Step 1: PRD-to-Prototype Strategy (10 minutes)

### Step 1A: PRD Analysis for Prototype Scope (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on the PRD I created in Phase 3, help me extract the key elements needed to build a focused prototype:
1. The specific product/focus area identified from transcript analysis
2. The primary use cases and customer scenarios outlined in the PRD
3. The success metrics and business objectives that the prototype should demonstrate
4. The stakeholder constraints and requirements that should guide design decisions

Analyze my PRD and create a prototype specification that translates the strategic analysis into concrete design requirements.
```

**Your Action:** Copy your Phase 3 PRD content into this conversation for AI analysis

### Step 1B: Prototype Requirements Definition (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
From the PRD analysis, help me define specific prototype requirements:
1. What conversation flows would best demonstrate the identified value proposition?
2. What realistic customer scenarios should the prototype showcase?
3. What specific features would prove the business case to executives?
4. What technical constraints should guide the no-code platform choice?

Create a focused prototype scope that directly supports the business case from my PRD.
```

**Expected Response:** Targeted prototype requirements based on strategic analysis

## Step 2: Comprehensive No-Code Builder Prompt Creation (12 minutes)

### Step 2A: Platform-Optimized Prompt Development (12 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on the prototype requirements we just defined, help me create a comprehensive prompt for a no-code platform (lovable.dev, bolt.new, v0.app, or replit.com) that includes:

1. **Business Context:** Executive demonstration for customer service automation project based on my PRD findings
2. **Product Focus:** Specific product/area identified in transcript analysis with realistic use cases
3. **UI Requirements:** Professional chat interface suitable for business presentation
4. **Content Strategy:** Realistic customer scenarios and responses based on my strategic analysis
5. **Conversation Flow:** Static screens that demonstrate the automation value proposition
6. **Technical Specs:** Platform-specific requirements for rapid prototype development

Make this prompt detailed enough that the no-code platform can generate a professional prototype that directly demonstrates the business value outlined in my PRD.
```

**AI will create a comprehensive, platform-ready prompt that translates your strategic work into executable design specifications**

## Step 3: Prototype Execution and Refinement (8 minutes)

### Step 3A: Prototype Execution (5 minutes)
**Use the comprehensive prompt created in Step 2A on your chosen no-code platform:**

**Platform Recommendations:**
- **lovable.dev**: Full-stack web application development with AI assistance
- **bolt.new**: Instant web app prototyping with modern frameworks  
- **v0.app**: AI-powered UI component and interface generation
- **replit.com**: Collaborative coding environment with instant deployment

**Execute the build using your AI-generated prompt**

### Step 3B: Prototype Validation and Refinement (3 minutes)
**After initial prototype generation, type:**
```
Review the prototype that was just generated against my PRD requirements. Does it effectively demonstrate:
1. The specific business value proposition identified in my transcript analysis?
2. The customer scenarios and use cases outlined in the PRD?
3. Professional presentation quality suitable for executive demonstration?
4. Clear visual demonstration of automation capabilities?

Suggest 2-3 specific improvements to better align the prototype with my strategic business case.
```

**Your Action:** Make targeted refinements based on AI feedback to ensure the prototype directly supports your Phase 3 analysis

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If your no-code platform has issues, add this to your prompt: *"Think harder about this request and reason through the technical requirements step by step."*

**Phase 4 Deliverable:** Static prototype screens ready for integration into Phase 5 pitch deck presentation

**Next Step:** Proceed to [Phase 5: Pitch Deck Creation](./phase5_pitch.md) where you'll integrate all your work into a compelling presidential presentation.
