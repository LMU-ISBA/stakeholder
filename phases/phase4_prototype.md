# Phase 4: Targeted Prototype Development (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Build focused prototype directly from the PRD created in Phase 3. Create comprehensive prompt for no-code builder that translates strategic analysis into demonstrable proof-of-concept.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 3: Analysis](./phase3_analysis.md) - Use PRD and strategic analysis to build targeted solution

---

## Step 1: PRD-to-Prototype Strategy (10 minutes)

### Step 1A: PRD Analysis for Prototype Scope (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on the PRD I created in Phase 3, help me extract the key elements needed to build a focused prototype:
1. The specific product/focus area identified from transcript analysis
2. The primary use cases and customer scenarios outlined in the PRD
3. The success metrics and business objectives that the prototype should demonstrate
4. The stakeholder constraints and requirements that should guide design decisions

Analyze my PRD and create a prototype specification that translates the strategic analysis into concrete design requirements.
```

**Your Action:** Copy your Phase 3 PRD content into this conversation for AI analysis

### Step 1B: Prototype Requirements Definition (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
From the PRD analysis, help me define specific prototype requirements:
1. What conversation flows would best demonstrate the identified value proposition?
2. What realistic customer scenarios should the prototype showcase?
3. What specific features would prove the business case to executives?
4. What technical constraints should guide the no-code platform choice?

Create a focused prototype scope that directly supports the business case from my PRD.
```

**Expected Response:** Targeted prototype requirements based on strategic analysis

## Step 2: Comprehensive No-Code Builder Prompt Creation (12 minutes)

### Step 2A: Platform-Optimized Prompt Development (12 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on the prototype requirements we just defined, help me create a comprehensive prompt for a no-code platform (lovable.dev, bolt.new, v0.app, or replit.com) that includes:

1. **Business Context:** Executive demonstration for customer service automation project based on my PRD findings
2. **Product Focus:** Specific product/area identified in transcript analysis with realistic use cases
3. **UI Requirements:** Professional chat interface suitable for business presentation
4. **Content Strategy:** Realistic customer scenarios and responses based on my strategic analysis
5. **Conversation Flow:** Static screens that demonstrate the automation value proposition
6. **Technical Specs:** Platform-specific requirements for rapid prototype development

Make this prompt detailed enough that the no-code platform can generate a professional prototype that directly demonstrates the business value outlined in my PRD.
```

**AI will create a comprehensive, platform-ready prompt that translates your strategic work into executable design specifications**

## Step 3: Prototype Execution and Refinement (8 minutes)

### Step 3A: Platform Selection with AI Guidance (3 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on our [PRODUCT] conversation flows and the need to demonstrate this to executives, help me choose the best prototyping platform from these options: lovable.dev, bolt.new, v0.app, or replit.com. Consider: ease of development, demonstration capabilities, realistic chat interface creation, and executive presentation value.
```

**Platform options:**
- **lovable.dev**: Full-stack web application development with AI assistance
- **bolt.new**: Instant web app prototyping with modern frameworks
- **v0.app**: AI-powered UI component and interface generation
- **replit.com**: Collaborative coding environment with instant deployment

### Step 3B: Rapid Prototype Development (5 minutes)
**First, create a comprehensive prompt for your no-code platform. Type:**
```
I need to create a detailed prompt for [chosen platform] to build a customer service chatbot UI prototype with static screens. Based on our [PRODUCT] conversation flows and business requirements, help me write a comprehensive prompt that includes:

1. Project context: customer service chatbot demonstration for executives
2. UI requirements: modern chat interface with message bubbles and input fields
3. Screen flow requirements: static screens showing our conversation flow with pre-written responses
4. Visual design: professional appearance suitable for business presentation
5. User interaction: click-through navigation between conversation steps (no backend/database needed)
6. Content specifications: realistic customer inputs and knowledge base responses we identified

Make this prompt detailed enough that the no-code platform can generate static prototype screens that demonstrate our conversation flow visually for executive presentation. Focus on UI mockups, not functional chat logic.
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt on your chosen platform to create:**

**Key Static Screens to Build:**
- Screen 1: Initial customer inquiry (with realistic customer message)
- Screen 2: Bot response asking clarifying questions
- Screen 3: Customer provides additional details
- Screen 4: Bot delivers knowledge base solution with next steps
- Screen 5: Resolution confirmation or escalation handoff

**Static Content to Include:**
- Pre-written realistic customer messages based on product research
- Pre-written bot responses using actual knowledge base content
- Visual conversation flow that can be clicked through step-by-step
- Professional chat interface design suitable for executive demonstration

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If your no-code platform throws errors or has trouble generating your prototype, try rewriting your prompt with this addition: *"Think harder about this request and reason through the technical requirements step by step."* This can trigger more sophisticated reasoning and often resolves complex generation issues.

**Focus on:** Visual demonstration of one complete conversation that executives can click through to see the automation in action

**Phase 4 Deliverable:** Static prototype screens ready for integration into Phase 5 pitch deck presentation

**Next Step:** Proceed to [Phase 5: Pitch Deck Creation](./phase5_pitch.md) where you'll integrate all your work into a compelling presidential presentation.
