## Step 1: AI-Assisted Presentation Strategy (8 minutes)

### Step 1A: Presentation Framework Development (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Help me create a strategic presentation framework for pitching a customer service automation internship project to a company president. This presentation needs to integrate:
- Research insights about the company and industry
- Specific findings from stakeholder discovery meeting
- Strategic focus decision and rationale  
- Working prototype demonstration
- Clear business case and ROI

Ask me questions about the audience and context to help structure the most effective presentation.
```

**AI will ask about:**
- Presidential decision criteria (ROI, risk, resources, timeline)
- Meeting format and time constraints
- Key stakeholders who might influence the decision
- Competing priorities or concerns to address
- Success metrics that matter most to leadership

**Your responses:**
- Criteria: Clear ROI, low risk, defined scope, academic partnership value
- Format: 15-20 minute presentation with Q&A
- Stakeholders: President, possibly operations manager, potentially other executives
- Concerns: Resource allocation, project scope creep, student capability questions
- Metrics: Cost savings, response time improvement, team capacity gains

### Step 1B: Story Arc Development (3 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on our context, help me create a compelling narrative arc for this presentation that builds credibility and momentum toward approval. Include the key story elements and logical flow.
```

**Expected Response:** Presentation structure that builds from problem → research → strategic insight → solution → business value → next steps

## Step 2: Content Integration & Slide Development (7 minutes)

### Step 2A: Key Message Development (4 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Help me develop the key messages for each section of our presentation. For each section, provide:
1. Core message/takeaway
2. Supporting evidence from our work
3. Visual/demonstration element
4. Transition to next section

Focus on making this data-driven and credible based on our research and discovery process.
```

**Section focus areas:**
- **Problem Validation:** Evidence from research and stakeholder discovery
- **Strategic Approach:** Why we focused on specific product area
- **Solution Demonstration:** Prototype showing realistic automation
- **Business Impact:** ROI projections and risk mitigation
- **Implementation Plan:** Academic partnership and next steps

### Step 2B: Slide Content Creation (3 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Create specific slide content for our presentation, including headlines, bullet points, and speaking notes. Focus on executive-level communication - clear, concise, business-focused.
```

**Key slides to create:**
1. **Executive Summary:** Problem, solution, business impact in 30 seconds
2. **Research Insights:** Key findings that led to strategic focus
3. **Discovery Results:** Stakeholder pain points and opportunity sizing
4. **Strategic Focus:** Why [product] based on data, not assumptions
5. **Prototype Demo:** Working solution with realistic scenarios
6. **Business Case:** ROI, risk mitigation, proof-of-concept approach
7. **Academic Partnership:** Value of intern + faculty collaboration
8. **Next Steps:** Clear implementation pathway and success metrics

## Step 3: Presentation Rehearsal & Refinement (5 minutes)

### Step 3A: AI Presentation Coaching (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Help me rehearse this presentation by playing the role of a skeptical company president. Ask challenging questions that a president might ask, and help me refine my responses. Focus on business justification, risk management, and ROI validation.
```

**Expected challenging questions:**
- "How do we know customers want automated support?"
- "What if the intern can't deliver quality work?"
- "Why not hire a consulting firm instead?"
- "What happens if this doesn't work - what's our risk?"
- "How do we measure success objectively?"

**Learning Point:** Prepare for executive skepticism with data-driven responses
