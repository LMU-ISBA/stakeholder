# Phase 5: Evidence-Based Pitch Deck Creation (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Create compelling presentation that integrates all previous work into a cohesive business case. Transform four phases of strategic analysis into executive-ready presentation with realistic stakeholder practice.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 4: Prototype](./phase4_prototype.md) - Use working prototype as centerpiece of business case presentation

---

## Step 1: Strategic Presentation Outline (7 minutes)

**Type:**
```
Create a structured ROLE CONTEXT TASKS OUTPUT FORMAT prompt for developing a comprehensive presentation outline that integrates all my work from Phases 1-4. The outline should create a compelling narrative for executive decision makers while positioning the internship opportunity and demonstrating clear business value.
```

**AI will generate an RCTO framework like:**
```
ROLE: [What type of presentation strategy expertise do we need?]

CONTEXT: [What should AI understand about the integrated work and executive audience?]

TASK: [What specific presentation elements need to be outlined?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [How should the presentation structure be organized?]
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt with your integrated work from all phases.**

**Your Action:** Provide AI with key insights from each phase (research findings, discovery insights, transcript analysis, PRD focus, prototype features) to create comprehensive presentation outline

## Step 2: Executive Slide Development (8 minutes)

**Type:**
```
Create a structured ROLE CONTEXT TASKS OUTPUT FORMAT prompt for developing executive-ready slide content that translates my presentation outline into professional slides with clear headlines, compelling bullets, and speaker notes. The slides should demonstrate data-driven decision making throughout the entire consulting process.
```

**AI will generate an RCTO framework like:**
```
ROLE: [What type of executive presentation expertise do we need?]

CONTEXT: [What should AI understand about the presentation outline and executive communication requirements?]

TASK: [What specific slide content and formats need to be created?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [How should the slides be structured for maximum executive impact?]
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt with your presentation outline to create complete slide content.**

**Your Action:** Use the structured prompt to develop 8-10 executive-ready slides that tell your complete story from initial research through working prototype

## Step 3: Multi-Stakeholder Presentation Practice (5 minutes)

**Type:**
```
Create a structured ROLE CONTEXT TASKS OUTPUT FORMAT prompt for setting up a realistic presentation practice session with multiple stakeholder perspectives. I need to practice presenting to both executive decision makers (focused on ROI, risk, resources) and the customer service lead (focused on operational impact, team concerns, implementation feasibility).
```

**AI will generate an RCTO framework like:**
```
ROLE: [What type of stakeholder simulation expertise do we need?]

CONTEXT: [What should AI understand about the presentation and different stakeholder perspectives?]

TASK: [What specific simulation scenarios and questions should be created?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [How should the multi-stakeholder practice session be structured?]
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt to practice your presentation with realistic stakeholder responses.**

**Your Action:** Present your slides to AI playing different stakeholder roles, responding to challenges and refining your delivery for maximum impact
