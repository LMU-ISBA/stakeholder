## Step 1: Basic Research Prompt Evolution (11 minutes)

### Step 1A: Level 1 - Basic Research Prompt (2 minutes)
**Open your AI tool and type exactly:**
```
Research Apogee Digital for a customer service automation project.
```

**Expected Response:** Generic company overview with basic information
**Learning Point:** Basic prompts give surface-level information without strategic focus

### Step 1B: Level 2 - AI-Guided Context Building (3 minutes)
**Now type:**
```
I need to research Apogee Digital for a customer service automation project, but I want you to ask me questions first to understand what kind of research would be most valuable. Ask me one question at a time about my research objectives and what I need to know.
```

**AI will ask questions like:**
- "What's your role in this project - are you evaluating, implementing, or consulting?"
- "What specific aspects of their business are most relevant to customer service automation?"
- "Are you more interested in their current challenges or their market position?"
- "What decisions will this research inform?"

**Your Workshop Responses:**
- Role: Student consultant preparing for discovery meeting with stakeholders
- Focus: Understanding their business context, customer types, and potential automation opportunities
- Interest: Both current challenges and market position to inform solution approach
- Decisions: What questions to ask in discovery meeting, how to position automation benefits

### Step 1C: Level 3 - Structured Research Prompt (3 minutes)
**Now create a structured prompt using this framework:**
```
ROLE: [What type of AI expertise do we need for this research?]

CONTEXT: [Based on our discussion, what background should AI understand about our situation?]

TASK: [What specific research deliverables do we need?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [What structure would be most useful for our discovery meeting preparation?]
```

**Work with AI to fill in each section:**
- **ROLE:** Discuss what kind of expert perspective would be most helpful
- **CONTEXT:** Include the key details AI needs to provide targeted advice
- **TASK:** Define specific, actionable research objectives
- **OUTPUT FORMAT:** Specify the structure that will best support your next steps

**Example completed prompt:**
```
ROLE: You are a business research analyst preparing for a discovery meeting with Apogee Digital about customer service automation opportunities.

CONTEXT: I'm a consultant preparing to meet with Apogee Digital stakeholders about implementing customer service automation. I need comprehensive background research to ask intelligent questions and understand their business context. Apogee Digital is a Santa Monica-based company that provides high-tech studio recording equipment to the recording industry.

TASK: Provide comprehensive business intelligence including:
1. Company overview: products, market position, customer segments
2. Industry context: professional audio equipment market trends and challenges  
3. Typical customer service challenges for B2B technical equipment companies
4. Customer types and their likely support needs (home users vs. professional studios)
5. Potential automation opportunities specific to technical product support

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Executive summary of key insights for discovery meeting preparation
- Five detailed research sections
- Strategic questions I should ask stakeholders based on this research
- Industry benchmarks and best practices relevant to their business
```

**Learning Point:** Structured frameworks with AI collaboration produce professional-quality business intelligence

### Step 1D: Prompt Improvement Iteration (3 minutes)
**Now ask AI to help you refine your prompt. Type:**
```
Review the structured research prompt I just created. What specific improvements would you suggest to make it more effective?
```

**AI will suggest improvements like:**
- Adding more specific context about the business situation
- Requesting particular types of evidence or data sources
- Clarifying the audience for the research output
- Including specific industry terminology or frameworks
- Defining success criteria for the research

**Your Action:** Take 1-2 of the suggestions and revise your prompt to incorporate them, then run the improved version.

**Learning Point:** Iterative prompt refinement through AI feedback develops stronger collaboration skills than having AI do all the work

## Step 2: Advanced Research with GPTOracle (12 minutes)

### Step 2A: Using GPTOracle AI Research Meta-Prompter (7 minutes)
**Navigate to:** https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67cf7a6be27c8191835abbb61a8f9bed-gptoracle-the-ai-research-meta-prompter

**Type:**
```
I need to research Apogee Digital and the professional audio industry for a customer service automation consulting project.
```

**GPTOracle will ask clarifying questions like:**
- "What specific business decisions will this research support?"
- "Are you more interested in their current operations or market opportunities?"
- "What type of customer service challenges are you trying to understand?"
- "How deep should the competitive analysis go?"
- "What's your timeline and deliverable format?"

**Your responses:**
- Decisions: Discovery meeting preparation, solution scoping, stakeholder engagement strategy
- Focus: Current customer service challenges and automation opportunities  
- Challenges: Technical product support complexity, customer diversity, scalability issues
- Competition: How similar B2B technical companies handle customer service automation
- Timeline: Need comprehensive insights quickly for immediate stakeholder meeting preparation

**GPTOracle will generate a sophisticated, structured research prompt optimized for your specific consulting needs**

### Step 2B: Execute Deep Research (~10 minutes)
**Copy the complete GPTOracle-generated prompt and paste into:**
- ChatGPT with Deep Research enabled, OR
- Claude with web search capabilities, OR  
- Perplexity for comprehensive research with citations

**Expected Response:** Professional-quality research report with specific insights, industry benchmarks, and strategic recommendations

**Note:** After the report is complete, check the multi-step reasoning process that Deep Research used to validate the thoroughness of the analysis.

**Alternative: Use Pre-completed Deep Research** 
Since Deep Research takes time with multi-step reasoning, you can use this completed example for Step 3 validation exercises: https://chatgpt.com/share/68baeda5-30d8-8002-9938-8f3f9f2a233f

**Learning Point:** Specialized AI tools like GPTOracle generate much more sophisticated research frameworks than general prompting

## Step 3: Research Validation & Discovery Gap Analysis (5 minutes)

**Type:**
```
Based on the research about Apogee Digital and customer service automation, I want you to:
1. Play devil's advocate - ruthlessly critique this research and highlight assumptions, blind spots, or flaws
2. Identify what additional information we need to validate these recommendations  
3. Suggest specific questions I should ask Apogee stakeholders that our research couldn't answer

What might we be missing or getting wrong, and what discovery questions will fill those gaps?
```

**Expected AI Response:**
- **Critical challenges:** "How do we know customers want automated support for technical issues?"
- **Assumption challenges:** "Are we assuming automation works for complex B2B products without evidence?"
- **Risk identification:** "What about damaging customer relationships with impersonal automation?"
- **Discovery questions:** Specific stakeholder questions to validate assumptions and fill research gaps

**Learning Point:** Critical analysis should directly lead to actionable discovery questions that validate assumptions

**Phase 1 Deliverable:** Comprehensive research brief with validated insights and strategic questions for discovery meeting
