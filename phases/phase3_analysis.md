# Phase 3: Strategic Analysis & PRD Development (22 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze the actual discovery meeting transcript to identify strategic opportunities. Make data-driven decision about which product area to focus on. Create PRD that positions internship project for president approval.

**CRITICAL LEARNING MOMENT:** This is where strategic scoping emerges from stakeholder insights, not predetermined assumptions.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 2: Discovery Preparation](./phase2_discovery.md) - Use prepared questions and framework to analyze real stakeholder input

## Step 1: Transcript Analysis with AI Scaffolding (15 minutes)

### Step 1A: Basic Transcript Analysis (3 minutes)
**Start a NEW chat session and upload the transcript file. Type:**
```
Analyze this stakeholder meeting transcript.
```

**Expected Response:** Basic summary of the meeting content without strategic insights
**Learning Point:** Generic analysis doesn't provide actionable business intelligence

### Step 1B: AI-Guided Analysis Development (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
I need to analyze this transcript strategically for a customer service automation project. Instead of just summarizing, I want you to ask me questions to understand what kind of analysis would be most valuable for making business decisions. Ask me one question at a time about my analysis objectives.
```

**AI will ask questions like:**
- "What business decisions will this analysis support?"
- "Are you looking for pain points, opportunities, or implementation requirements?"
- "Who is the ultimate decision-maker and what do they care about?"
- "What specific insights do you need to move the project forward?"
- "Are there particular patterns or themes you want me to focus on?"

**Your responses:**
- Decisions: Which product area to focus prototype on, how to scope internship project, what ROI to project
- Focus: Pain points AND opportunities, especially product-specific challenges
- Decision-maker: Company president who cares about ROI, risk management, resource allocation
- Insights: Specific products mentioned, volume indicators, team capacity issues, success metrics
- Patterns: Look for repeated mentions of specific products, most frustrating issues, automation opportunities

### Step 1C: Structured Transcript Analysis (7 minutes)
**Understanding the progression:** Step 1A shows basic prompting limitations, Step 1B demonstrates AI collaboration, but for efficiency, **jump straight to AI-generated structured prompting.**

**Type:**
```
Create a structured ROLE CONTEXT TASKS OUTPUT FORMAT prompt for analyzing this stakeholder transcript to support strategic business decisions about customer service automation focus areas. I need to identify specific products, constraints, opportunities, and success metrics to scope an internship project for executive approval.
```

**AI will generate a comprehensive RCTO framework like:**
```
ROLE: [What type of business analyst expertise do we need?]

CONTEXT: [What should AI understand about this transcript and our objectives?]

TASK: [What specific insights do we need to extract from this transcript?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [How should the analysis be structured for business decision-making?]

FILES: [Transcript attached]
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt to analyze your transcript.**

**Key guidance for your prompt construction:**
- Focus on identifying **specific products** mentioned as problematic
- Look for **volume indicators** and team capacity issues
- Extract **success metrics** and business objectives
- Identify **strategic opportunities** for automation focus
- Extract **constraints** spoken by stakeholders (budget, timeline, technical limitations, resource availability)
- Include **specific quotes** to support findings

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY MOMENT:** Your prompt should help AI identify patterns that suggest which products drive the most support volume and complexity. This analysis should directly reveal your product focus area.

**Learning Point:** Building structured prompts yourself develops strategic thinking about what questions to ask of the data. Your analysis should clearly identify which product area to focus the prototype on based on stakeholder evidence.

## Step 2: PRD Development (15 minutes)

### Step 2A: AI-Generated PRD Framework (15 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on my transcript analysis findings, create a structured ROLE CONTEXT TASKS OUTPUT FORMAT prompt for developing a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a customer service automation internship project. Use the specific insights, constraints, stakeholder concerns, and success metrics I identified from the transcript to inform each element of the prompt framework.
```

**AI will generate a comprehensive RCTO framework like:**
```
ROLE: [What type of PRD expertise do we need?]

CONTEXT: [What background should AI understand about the transcript insights and business situation?]

TASK: [What specific PRD components need to be developed?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [How should the PRD be structured for stakeholder approval?]
```

**Then use the AI-generated prompt to create your PRD.**

**Key Elements to Include:**
- **Problem Statement:** Based on specific issues identified in transcript
- **Proposed Solution:** Focused automation for [identified product area]
- **Strategic Rationale:** Why this specific focus area based on stakeholder insights
- **Proof-of-Concept Approach:** Start small, prove value, then scale
- **Academic Value:** Learning outcomes for intern, faculty expertise contribution
- **Business Impact:** Projected time savings, improved response times, team capacity

**Phase 3 Deliverable:** Strategic PRD with data-driven product focus and compelling business case based on stakeholder evidence
