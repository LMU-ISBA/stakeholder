# Phase 3: Strategic Analysis & PRD Development (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze the actual discovery meeting transcript to identify strategic opportunities. Make data-driven decision about which product area to focus on. Create PRD that positions internship project for president approval.

**CRITICAL LEARNING MOMENT:** This is where strategic scoping emerges from stakeholder insights, not predetermined assumptions.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 2: Discovery Preparation](./phase2_discovery.md) - Use prepared questions and framework to analyze real stakeholder input

## Step 1: Transcript Analysis with AI Scaffolding (15 minutes)

### Step 1A: Basic Transcript Analysis (3 minutes)
**Start a NEW chat session and upload the transcript file. Type:**
```
Analyze this stakeholder meeting transcript.
```

**Expected Response:** Basic summary of the meeting content without strategic insights
**Learning Point:** Generic analysis doesn't provide actionable business intelligence

### Step 1B: AI-Guided Analysis Development (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
I need to analyze this transcript strategically for a customer service automation project. Instead of just summarizing, I want you to ask me questions to understand what kind of analysis would be most valuable for making business decisions. Ask me one question at a time about my analysis objectives.
```

**AI will ask questions like:**
- "What business decisions will this analysis support?"
- "Are you looking for pain points, opportunities, or implementation requirements?"
- "Who is the ultimate decision-maker and what do they care about?"
- "What specific insights do you need to move the project forward?"
- "Are there particular patterns or themes you want me to focus on?"

**Your responses:**
- Decisions: Which product area to focus prototype on, how to scope internship project, what ROI to project
- Focus: Pain points AND opportunities, especially product-specific challenges
- Decision-maker: Company president who cares about ROI, risk management, resource allocation
- Insights: Specific products mentioned, volume indicators, team capacity issues, success metrics
- Patterns: Look for repeated mentions of specific products, most frustrating issues, automation opportunities

### Step 1C: Structured Transcript Analysis (7 minutes)
**Type:**
```
ROLE: You are a senior business analyst specializing in customer service automation projects for B2B technical companies.

CONTEXT: This transcript is from a discovery meeting with Apogee Digital stakeholders about customer service automation. I'm preparing to create a focused internship project proposal for the company president. I need strategic insights that will help me identify the highest-impact opportunity and justify resource investment.

TASK: Analyze this transcript to identify:
1. Specific products or product categories mentioned as problematic
2. Volume indicators and capacity constraints 
3. Customer impact issues (response times, satisfaction, complexity)
4. Team pain points and operational challenges
5. Success metrics and business objectives mentioned
6. Strategic opportunities for automation focus

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Executive summary with key strategic insights
- Six detailed analysis sections with specific quotes from transcript
- Strategic recommendation for project focus area
- Business case elements for president presentation
- Risk factors and implementation considerations

FILES: [Transcript attached]
```

**Expected Response:** Professional strategic analysis that identifies specific business opportunities
**Learning Point:** Structured prompts with clear business objectives produce actionable strategic insights

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY MOMENT:** Look for patterns in the AI analysis that suggest which products drive the most support volume and complexity.

## Step 2: Strategic Focus Decision (8 minutes)

### Step 2A: Product Focus Identification (4 minutes)
**Based on the transcript analysis, type:**
```
Based on your analysis of the transcript, which specific product or product area should we focus our automation prototype on? Provide your reasoning based on evidence from the stakeholder conversation.
```

**Expected AI Response:** Data-driven recommendation for product focus (likely mentioning specific product names, customer types, or problem categories that came up most frequently in stakeholder discussion)

**Learning Point:** Strategic decisions should be based on stakeholder evidence, not assumptions

### Step 2B: Focus Validation Research (4 minutes)
**Once you have a product focus recommendation, type:**
```
Now that we've identified [PRODUCT] as our focus area, help me research this product specifically. What should I investigate about [PRODUCT] to validate that this is the right choice for a proof-of-concept automation project?
```

**AI will guide you to research:**
- Product complexity and common customer issues
- Available support documentation and knowledge base
- Customer types who use this product
- Typical support interaction patterns

**Action:** Briefly research the recommended product using available resources (website, knowledge base, etc.)

## Step 3: PRD Development for President Approval (7 minutes)

### Step 3A: AI-Guided PRD Creation (7 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Help me create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a customer service automation internship project. The goal is to get approval from the company president for an intern to work on this with faculty mentorship. Ask me questions to understand what should be included to make this compelling for executive approval.
```

**AI will guide you through:**
- Executive summary and business case
- Project scope and focus rationale (based on transcript analysis)
- Success metrics and ROI projections
- Resource requirements (intern + faculty time)
- Risk mitigation and proof-of-concept approach
- Implementation timeline and milestones
- Academic partnership benefits

**Key Elements to Include:**
- **Problem Statement:** Based on specific issues identified in transcript
- **Proposed Solution:** Focused automation for [identified product area]
- **Strategic Rationale:** Why this specific focus area based on stakeholder insights
- **Proof-of-Concept Approach:** Start small, prove value, then scale
- **Academic Value:** Learning outcomes for intern, faculty expertise contribution
- **Business Impact:** Projected time savings, improved response times, team capacity

**Phase 3 Deliverable:** Strategic PRD with data-driven product focus and compelling business case for president approval
