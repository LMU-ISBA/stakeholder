# Phase 2: Discovery Meeting Preparation (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Create strategic framework for stakeholder discovery meeting. Develop agenda and questions that will uncover specific pain points to drive strategic focus decisions.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 1: Research](./phase1_research.md) - Use insights from research to inform discovery strategy

---

## Step 1: AI-Generated Meeting Agenda (10 minutes)

### Step 1A: Basic Agenda Request (2 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Create a meeting agenda for a discovery meeting about customer service automation.
```

**Expected Response:** Generic meeting structure without strategic focus
**Learning Point:** Basic requests produce generic, non-strategic results

### Step 1B: AI-Guided Agenda Development (8 minutes)
**Type:**
```
I need to create a strategic agenda for a discovery meeting with Apogee Digital stakeholders about customer service automation. Instead of just giving me an agenda, I want you to ask me questions to understand the meeting context and objectives so you can help me create a more effective agenda.
```

**AI will ask questions like:**
- "Who will be attending this meeting and what are their roles?"
- "What are your primary objectives for this discovery session?"
- "How long is the meeting and what's the decision-making process after?"
- "What information do you most need to gather to move the project forward?"
- "Are there any sensitive topics or concerns you need to navigate carefully?"

**Your responses based on research:**
- Attendees: Support team lead, operations manager, possibly other technical staff
- Objectives: Understand current pain points, validate automation opportunity, identify highest-impact areas
- Meeting: 60 minutes, need to build case for president approval afterwards
- Information: Current ticket volumes, most problematic products/issues, team capacity constraints
- Sensitivities: Team might worry about job security, need to position as augmentation not replacement

**Expected AI Response:** Strategic meeting agenda that builds stakeholder buy-in and gathers decision-relevant information

## Step 2: Strategic Discovery Questions Development (15 minutes)

### Step 2A: AI-Generated Question Framework (10 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on our agenda discussion, help me create strategic discovery questions for this meeting. I want you to ask me questions first to understand what kind of insights would be most valuable, then help me develop a comprehensive question framework.
```

**AI will coach you through:**
- Business impact questions vs. technical feature questions
- Open-ended vs. closed questions for different objectives  
- Question sequencing for stakeholder psychology
- Validation questions for assumptions from your research
- Follow-up and probing question techniques

**Key areas AI will help you develop questions for:**
- Current state assessment (pain points, volumes, processes)
- **Product-specific challenges** (which products drive most tickets - this is crucial!)
- Customer impact and satisfaction issues
- Team capacity and capability constraints
- Success criteria and measurement approaches
- Implementation concerns and change management

### Step 2B: Question Prioritization Strategy (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Help me prioritize these discovery questions for a 60-minute meeting. Consider stakeholder engagement, information gathering efficiency, and building toward a strategic recommendation.
```

**Expected Response:** Prioritized question list with timing recommendations and strategic rationale

## Step 3: Discovery Meeting Simulation (5 minutes)

### Step 3A: Scenario-Based Practice (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Let's simulate this discovery meeting. You'll play the role of a support team lead based on the stakeholder context we discussed. Present me with 3 different ways this meeting might play out - optimistic, realistic, and challenging scenarios. I want to practice handling different stakeholder responses.
```

**Practice scenarios:**
- **Optimistic:** Stakeholder is very collaborative and shares detailed pain points
- **Realistic:** Stakeholder is helpful but has some concerns about automation impact  
- **Challenging:** Stakeholder is skeptical or defensive about current processes

**Learning Point:** Prepare for multiple stakeholder personalities and response patterns

**Phase 2 Deliverable:** Strategic discovery meeting agenda with prioritized questions and scenario preparation

**Next Step:** Proceed to [Phase 3: Strategic Analysis & PRD](./phase3_analysis.md) where you'll analyze the actual stakeholder transcript to make strategic decisions.
