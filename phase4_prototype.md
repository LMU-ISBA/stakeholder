# Phase 4: Targeted Prototype Development (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Build focused prototype for the specific product area identified in Phase 3. Create realistic conversation flows using actual product knowledge base content. Demonstrate proof-of-concept approach.

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 3: Analysis](./phase3_analysis.md) - Use product focus decision and validation research to build targeted solution

## Step 1: Product-Specific Research Deep Dive (10 minutes)

### Step 1A: Knowledge Base Analysis (5 minutes)
**Based on your Phase 3 product focus decision, research the specific product's support resources:**

**For example, if you identified a specific product, navigate to its knowledge base or support documentation**

**Type:**
```
I've identified [PRODUCT NAME] as our prototype focus based on stakeholder insights. Help me analyze the support documentation and knowledge base for this product to understand:
1. Most common customer issues and questions
2. Complexity patterns in the support content
3. Types of issues that could be automated vs. need human expertise
4. Conversation flow opportunities for chatbot interactions
```

**Action:** Browse the product's knowledge base and documentation to understand support complexity

### Step 1B: Automation Opportunity Assessment (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on the [PRODUCT] knowledge base I just reviewed, help me identify the top 3 conversation flows that would be most suitable for chatbot automation. Consider: frequency of issues, availability of clear answers, and ability to guide customers through solutions step-by-step.
```

**Expected Response:** Specific conversation flow recommendations based on actual product support content

## Step 2: Conversation Flow Design (12 minutes)

### Step 2A: AI-Assisted Flow Architecture (7 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Help me design detailed conversation flows for [PRODUCT] customer support automation. I want to focus on the top conversation flows we identified. For each flow, help me create:
1. Entry points (how customers might express this need)
2. Information gathering questions 
3. Decision tree logic based on customer responses
4. Resolution paths using actual knowledge base content
5. Escalation triggers for human handoff

Let's start with the first flow: [MOST COMMON ISSUE IDENTIFIED]
```

**AI will help create realistic conversation flows using actual product complexity**

### Step 2B: Content Integration Strategy (5 minutes)
**Type:**
```
For these conversation flows, how should we integrate the existing [PRODUCT] knowledge base content? Help me design a strategy that uses the actual support articles and documentation as chatbot responses while maintaining conversational flow.
```

**Expected Response:** Strategy for leveraging existing content in automated conversations

## Step 3: Prototype Creation (8 minutes)

### Step 3A: Platform Selection with AI Guidance (3 minutes)
**Type:**
```
Based on our [PRODUCT] conversation flows and the need to demonstrate this to executives, help me choose the best prototyping approach. Consider: ease of development, demonstration capabilities, integration with existing systems, and ability to show realistic interactions.
```

**Platform options might include:**
- **Figma**: High-fidelity mockups with click-through interactions
- **Simple chatbot builder**: Functional prototype with basic logic
- **Presentation format**: Screen flows with realistic content

### Step 3B: Rapid Prototype Development (5 minutes)
**Using your chosen platform, create:**

**Key Screens/Interactions to Build:**
- Initial customer inquiry (showing multiple ways to express the same need)
- Information gathering sequence 
- Decision point with branching logic
- Resolution screen with knowledge base content
- Escalation handoff screen

**Content to Include:**
- Realistic customer inputs based on product research
- Actual knowledge base content formatted for chat
- Clear escalation criteria and handoff process
- Business value demonstration (time saved, accuracy improved)

**Focus on:** One complete conversation flow that works end-to-end rather than multiple incomplete flows

**Phase 4 Deliverable:** Working prototype demonstrating specific product automation with realistic content and clear business value
