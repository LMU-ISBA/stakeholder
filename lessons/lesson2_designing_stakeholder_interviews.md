# Lesson 2: Designing Stakeholder Interviews (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Design strategic interview questions that gather comprehensive information for discovery meetings, progressing from generic business insights to PRD-specific requirements.

**Learning Outcome:** Create two sets of targeted interview questions - one for general stakeholder discovery and another specifically designed to gather information needed for ChatPRD template completion.

---

## Phase 1: Generic Discovery Interview Design (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Generate Generic Discovery Framework (5 minutes)

**Using your Deep Research insights from Lesson 1, type this prompt:**

```
Structured RCTO Prompt:
ROLE: [What type of expertise do we need for this research?]

CONTEXT: [What background should the AI understand about our situation?]

TASK: [What specific deliverables do we need?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [What structure would be most useful for our discovery meeting preparation?]

â€”
Write a prompt following the structure above for this topic:
To prepare for a discovery meeting with Apogee Digital and their customer support manager.

Context:
[Fill in with the Deep Research Executive Summary from Lesson 1]
```

**Instructions:**
1. **Copy your Deep Research Executive Summary** from Lesson 1 and paste it in the Context section
2. **AI will generate a structured RCTO prompt** for generic stakeholder discovery
3. **Review the generated framework** - this will help you understand general business discovery approaches

### Step 2: Execute Generic Discovery Questions (5 minutes)

**Use the AI-generated RCTO prompt to create your first set of interview questions.**

**Expected outputs:**
- General business context questions
- Current state assessment questions
- Challenge identification questions
- Solution exploration questions
- Implementation readiness questions

**Save these questions** - you'll compare them to PRD-specific questions in Phase 2.

## Phase 2: PRD-Focused Interview Design (10 minutes)

### Step 2A: Generate PRD-Aligned Interview Framework (7 minutes)

**Now type this enhanced prompt that aligns with ChatPRD template requirements:**

```
Structured Prompt to Fill in PRD:
ROLE: [What type of expertise do we need for this research?]

CONTEXT: [What background should the AI understand about our situation?]

TASK: [What specific deliverables do we need?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [What structure would be most useful for our discovery meeting preparation?]

â€”
Write a prompt following the structure above for this topic:

To prepare for a discovery meeting with Apogee Digital and their customer support manager. After the meeting, we will prepare a PRD with the sections outlined in the <PRD> section below.

Context:
[Fill in with the Deep Research Executive Summary from Lesson 1]

<PRD>
### TL;DR
Write a clear, concise 2â€“3 sentence summary describing the problem, core benefits, basic features, and intended audience.

---

## Goals
### Business Goals
List 3â€“5 measurable objectives aligned to company/business priorities.

### User Goals
List 3â€“5 key user outcomes or benefits. Focus on solving real user needs.

### Non-Goals
List 2â€“3 items that are not in scope for this project. Be explicit to avoid scope creep.

---

## User Stories
For each user persona (real roles, e.g., Customer, Support Agent), provide multiple user stories in the following format:
- As a <USER TYPE>, I want to <ACTION>, so that <BENEFIT>.

---

## Functional Requirements
List features and requirements, grouped by product area and prioritized.
- <Feature Group> (Priority: <PRIORITY>)
  -- <Feature Name:> <Short feature description>

---

## User Experience
Provide a detailed, stepwise journey through the product:
- Entry Point & First-Time User Experience: Describe first access and onboarding.
- Core Experience: Describe main flows step by step from user perspective, including UI/UX and data/validation.
- Advanced Features & Edge Cases: Address power-users and error conditions.
- UI/UX Highlights: List key accessibility or design priorities.

---

## Narrative
Craft a 200â€“300 word story illustrating a typical user's challenge, how the product helps, and the final outcomeâ€”emphasizing both business and end-user wins.

---

## Success Metrics
List 4â€“6 clear measures of success, and organize into the following groups:
### User-Centric Metrics
### Business Metrics
### Technical Metrics
### Tracking Plan

---

## Technical Considerations
Outline the most relevant implementation challenges and factors:
- Technical Needs: APIs, data models, components.
- Integration Points: Existing systems or 3rd parties.
- Data Storage & Privacy: Data flow and compliance.
- Scalability & Performance: Key demands and projections.
- Potential Challenges: Risks or complexities to consider.

---

## Milestones & Sequencing
Provide an actionable, pragmatic roadmap:
- Project Estimate: Use startup-friendly (not enterprise) timeframes (Extra-small, Small, Medium, Large).
- Team Size & Composition: Keep teams lean. Prefer 1â€“2 people for small projects.
- Suggested Phases: Name each phase, its duration, deliverables, and dependencies.
</PRD>
```

**AI will generate a comprehensive RCTO framework specifically designed to gather PRD-ready information.**

### Step 2B: Execute PRD-Aligned Questions (3 minutes)

**Use the AI-generated PRD-focused prompt to create your strategic interview questions.**

**Expected PRD-aligned outputs:**
- **Goals Section Questions:** Business objectives, user outcomes, scope boundaries
- **User Stories Questions:** Persona identification, workflow needs, benefit validation
- **Functional Requirements Questions:** Feature prioritization, capability needs
- **User Experience Questions:** Journey mapping, pain points, interaction preferences
- **Success Metrics Questions:** Measurement criteria, tracking approaches
- **Technical Considerations Questions:** Integration needs, constraints, scalability
- **Milestones Questions:** Timeline expectations, resource availability, project phases

---

## Critical Action: Save Your Questions (Required)

### ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT: Copy and Save Both Question Sets**

**You MUST copy and paste both sets of generated questions into a document/notes:**

1. **Generic Discovery Questions** (from Phase 1)
2. **PRD-Aligned Interview Questions** (from Phase 2)

**Why this is critical:**
- **Lesson 3 Requirement:** You'll use these exact questions in AI-simulated stakeholder interviews
- **Comparison Analysis:** You'll see how PRD-focus changes question strategy
- **Interview Practice:** These become your actual interview scripts for role-play
- **Quality Control:** You can refine questions before live stakeholder simulation

**Format for saving:**
```
=== GENERIC DISCOVERY QUESTIONS ===
[Paste Phase 1 questions here]

=== PRD-ALIGNED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ===
[Paste Phase 2 questions here]
```

## Lesson 2 Deliverable

**You should now have:**
1. **Generic Discovery Question Set:** Broad stakeholder exploration questions
2. **PRD-Aligned Question Set:** Strategic questions mapped to ChatPRD template sections
3. **Question Comparison Analysis:** Understanding of how purpose shapes interview design
4. **Interview Scripts Ready:** Saved questions for Lesson 3 AI simulation practice
5. **Strategic Interview Mindset:** Ability to design purpose-driven stakeholder conversations

---

## Self-Assessment Questions

- Can I explain the difference between generic and PRD-focused interview approaches?
- Do my questions map clearly to specific ChatPRD template sections?
- Have I saved both question sets for use in Lesson 3 stakeholder simulations?
- Am I prepared to gather comprehensive information that will enable PRD completion?
- Do I understand how interview purpose should shape question design?
