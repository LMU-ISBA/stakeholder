# Lesson 3: Conducting Stakeholder Interviews (25 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice conducting stakeholder interviews through AI simulation, using your prepared questions from Lesson 2 and adapting your approach based on stakeholder responses and personality types.

**Learning Outcome:** Develop real-time interview skills including question adaptation, follow-up probing, and stakeholder personality management while gathering PRD-ready information.

---

## Step 1: Generate AI Interview Simulation Framework (5 minutes)

**Using your saved questions from Lesson 2, type this prompt:**

```
ROLE: [What type of expertise do we need for this research?]

CONTEXT: [What background should the AI understand about our situation?]

TASK: [What specific deliverables do we need?]

OUTPUT FORMAT: [What structure would be most useful for our discovery meeting preparation?]

—
Write a prompt following the structure above for this topic:

Simulate an initial discovery meeting with Apogee's customer support manager. Present one question at a time, allowing me to ask follow-up questions. I will start the simulation by asking a question. Make sure the possibility of a chatbot is raised.

Draw from two scenario categories and let me choose one option from each to create a combined persona for role-play.

Clarity of Needs:
Clear: Stakeholder articulates specific challenges, goals, and success measures.
Vague: Stakeholder provides broad, non-specific answers and struggles to define priorities.

Attitude Toward the Project:
Optimistic: Stakeholder is cooperative, open-minded, and solution-oriented.
Pessimistic: Stakeholder is resistant, skeptical, or focused on risks and barriers.
```

**AI will generate a comprehensive RCTO framework for realistic stakeholder simulation with personality variables.**

---

## Step 2: Execute AI Stakeholder Simulation (15 minutes)

### Step 2A: Set Up Simulation Persona (3 minutes)

**Use the AI-generated RCTO prompt to start your simulation.**

**AI will present scenario options like:**
```
Clarity of Needs:
1. Clear: I can articulate specific challenges and success measures
2. Vague: I provide broad answers and struggle with priorities

Attitude Toward Project:
1. Optimistic: Cooperative and solution-oriented
2. Pessimistic: Resistant and focused on risks

Please select one option from each category.
```

**Choose your combination to create a realistic stakeholder personality for practice.**

### Step 2B: Conduct Interview Practice (12 minutes)

**Interview Structure:**
1. **Use your PRD-aligned questions from Lesson 2** as your starting point
2. **Start the simulation** by asking your first prepared question
3. **Adapt based on AI stakeholder responses** - this is the key learning moment
4. **Ask follow-up questions** to dig deeper into stakeholder insights
5. **Probe for PRD-specific information** when stakeholder gives vague answers
6. **Handle resistance or enthusiasm** appropriately based on chosen personality

**Key Skills to Practice:**

**Question Adaptation:**
- When stakeholder gives vague answer → Ask for specific examples
- When stakeholder seems resistant → Probe for underlying concerns
- When stakeholder is enthusiastic → Ensure you capture concrete details
- When chatbot possibility emerges → Explore benefits and concerns thoroughly

**Follow-up Techniques:**
- "Can you give me a specific example of when that happened?"
- "What would success look like from your perspective?"
- "What concerns do you have about that approach?"
- "How does that impact your team's daily workflow?"
- "What metrics would help you measure improvement?"

**PRD Information Gathering:**
- **Business Goals:** "What are your top 3 priorities for this project?"
- **User Stories:** "Walk me through a typical support interaction"
- **Technical Constraints:** "What systems would this need to integrate with?"
- **Success Metrics:** "How would you measure if this is working?"

## Step 3: Interview Reflection & Analysis (5 minutes)

### Step 3A: Immediate Debrief (2 minutes)

**After completing your simulation, ask the AI:**
```
Now step out of role and provide feedback on my interview approach. What did I do well, and where could I improve my questioning technique or stakeholder management?
```

**Focus on:**
- Question effectiveness and follow-up quality
- How well you adapted to stakeholder personality
- Whether you gathered PRD-ready information
- Missed opportunities for deeper insights

### Step 3B: Extract Interview Insights (3 minutes)

**Type this analysis prompt:**
```
Based on our simulated interview, help me organize the insights I gathered into the ChatPRD template sections:

1. Goals (Business Goals, User Goals, Non-Goals)
2. User Stories (by persona type)
3. Functional Requirements (features and priorities)
4. User Experience (current pain points and desired flows)
5. Success Metrics (measurement criteria)
6. Technical Considerations (constraints, integrations)
7. Milestones & Sequencing (timeline and resource insights)

What additional information would I still need to gather for a complete PRD?
```

**Expected Output:**
- Insights organized by PRD section
- Identification of information gaps
- Additional questions needed for complete PRD
- Assessment of stakeholder interview quality

## Lesson 3 Deliverable

**You should now have:**
1. **Interview Simulation Experience:** Hands-on practice with realistic stakeholder personality
2. **Adaptive Questioning Skills:** Ability to modify approach based on stakeholder responses
3. **PRD-Ready Insights:** Information organized by ChatPRD template sections
4. **Interview Assessment:** Understanding of your interview strengths and improvement areas
5. **Gap Analysis:** Clear picture of additional information needed for complete PRD

---

## Self-Assessment Questions

- Can I adapt my interview approach based on stakeholder personality and responses?
- Do I ask effective follow-up questions that deepen understanding?
- Am I gathering information that maps clearly to PRD sections?
- Can I handle both enthusiastic and resistant stakeholders professionally?
- Do I know what additional information I need for PRD completion?

---

## Advanced Practice (Optional)

**If time permits, try a second simulation with different personality combination:**
- Switch from Clear to Vague (or vice versa)
- Switch from Optimistic to Pessimistic (or vice versa)
- Compare how your interview approach needs to change
- Note which personality combinations are most challenging
