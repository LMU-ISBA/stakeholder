---

## Phase 1: AI-Assisted Research & Domain Understanding (45 minutes)

### Activity 1: Business Intelligence Gathering (15 minutes)

#### Setup (2 minutes)
**Instructions:**
- Form teams of 2-3 students
- Designate one person as "AI collaborator" and one as "business analyst"
- Rotate these roles throughout the workshop

#### Facilitation Approach (13 minutes)
**Circulate and Coach:**
- Visit each team within first 5 minutes to ensure they're on track
- Help teams refine their AI prompts for better results
- Look for teams struggling with AI tool usage

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **Too broad prompts:** Help narrow focus to specific business questions
- **Accepting first AI response:** Encourage iterative questioning
- **Not connecting to business case:** Redirect to Apogee-specific insights

**Quality Check Questions:**
- "How does this research specifically help with Apogee's challenges?"
- "What follow-up questions should you ask the AI?"
- "Are you getting actionable insights or just general information?"

#### Facilitation Script:
"I'm seeing some great research happening. Remember, you're not just gathering general information about the audio industry - you're building specific insights that will help you design a solution for Apogee's unique challenges. Push your AI collaboration further by asking follow-up questions."

### Activity 2: Stakeholder Needs Analysis (20 minutes)

#### Setup (3 minutes)
**Distribute transcript** (ensure digital and backup print copies)

**Key Instructions:**
- Read transcript first, then use AI for analysis
- Focus on extracting specific, actionable requirements
- Look for contradictions or gaps in stakeholder statements

#### Facilitation Approach (17 minutes)
**Coaching Focus Areas:**

**Minutes 3-8: Reading & Initial Analysis**
- Encourage active reading with highlighting/notes
- Suggest teams divide transcript sections among members
- Look for teams rushing through without deep reading

**Minutes 8-15: AI Collaboration**
- Help teams craft specific analysis prompts
- Encourage asking for specific quotes to support findings
- Push for prioritization and categorization

**Minutes 15-20: Synthesis & Documentation**
- Ensure teams are creating their own insights, not just copying AI output
- Ask probing questions about stakeholder priorities
- Help teams identify gaps that need discovery questions

**Red Flags to Address:**
- Teams copying AI output verbatim without analysis
- Missing key stakeholder concerns from transcript
- Focusing on features instead of business problems

#### Sample Coaching Questions:
- "What did the AI miss that you caught from reading the transcript?"
- "Which stakeholder concern seems most urgent based on their language?"
- "How do the technical constraints impact your solution approach?"

### Activity 3: Solution Landscape Research (10 minutes)

#### Facilitation Focus
This is the shortest activity, so keep teams moving quickly while ensuring quality.

**Key Coaching Points:**
- Encourage teams to focus on B2B technical support specifically
- Push for competitive intelligence, not just best practices
- Ask teams to identify 2-3 specific actionable takeaways

**Time Management:**
- Give 2-minute warning at 8 minutes
- Ask teams to verbally share one key insight at the end
- Use insights to transition to Phase 2

#### Transition Script:
"Great research! You now have solid business context, stakeholder requirements, and market intelligence. Phase 2 is about turning these insights into strategic discovery questions that would uncover even more detail in a real client meeting."

---

## Phase 2: Strategic Discovery Preparation (45 minutes)

### Activity 4: Discovery Questions Development (20 minutes)

#### Setup (3 minutes)
**Emphasize Strategic Thinking:**
"You're not just creating a list of questions - you're designing a conversation that will uncover the insights needed to build the right solution."

**Quality Criteria to Share:**
- Questions should be open-ended, not yes/no
- Each question should have a clear business purpose
- Questions should build on previous answers
- Balance between business and technical focus

#### Facilitation Approach (17 minutes)

**Minutes 0-5: AI Collaboration Setup**
- Help teams synthesize their Phase 1 findings into AI context
- Ensure they're providing rich background in their prompts
- Look for teams asking for quantity vs. quality

**Minutes 5-12: Question Development**
- Encourage iteration - first AI output is rarely the best
- Push teams to ask "why is this question important?"
- Help categorize questions by stakeholder and timing

**Minutes 12-17: Quality Review**
- Ask teams to identify their 5 best questions
- Role-play scenarios to test question effectiveness
- Ensure business focus, not just technical features

**Coaching Techniques:**
- **Question Quality Test:** "If you only had time for 3 questions, which would they be?"
- **Stakeholder Perspective:** "How would Chris from the transcript respond to this question?"
- **Business Value Focus:** "How does this question's answer impact the solution design?"

#### Red Flags:
- Generic questions that could apply to any company
- All technical questions with no business context
- Closed-ended questions that limit discussion
- Questions that ignore stakeholder concerns from transcript

### Activity 5: Question Prioritization & Strategy (15 minutes)

- Look for opportunities to share strong examples

**Advanced Facilitation:**
- Ask teams to role-play with one person as skeptical stakeholder
- Have them practice transitioning between question topics
- Encourage thinking about follow-up questions and probes

### Activity 6: Discovery Call Simulation (10 minutes)

#### High-Energy Activity
This should be the most interactive part of Phase 2.

#### Setup (2 minutes)
**Role Assignments:**
- One student plays Chris (support lead) using transcript context
- One student plays Operations Manager using business concerns
- One student leads discovery using developed questions

#### Facilitation (8 minutes)
**Observation Focus:**
- Are students using their prioritized questions?
- How well do they handle unexpected responses?
- Are they listening and asking follow-ups?

**Coaching During Activity:**
- Prompt "stakeholders" to be realistic (not too easy or difficult)
- Help "consultants" when they get stuck
- Encourage authentic business dialogue

**Debrief Questions:**
- "What questions worked best in the actual conversation?"
- "What surprised you about the stakeholder responses?"
- "How would you modify your approach based on this experience?"

#### Transition to Phase 3:
"Excellent discovery skills! Now you have the business intelligence and stakeholder insights needed to design a solution. Phase 3 is where you'll architect and prototype your chatbot recommendation."

### Activity 8: Conversation Flow Design (30 minutes)

#### This is a Critical Activity
Conversation design is where business requirements meet user experience. This determines solution success.

#### Facilitation Approach

**Minutes 0-5: Conversation Design Principles**
**Key Teaching Points:**
- Conversations should feel natural, not robotic
- Always have fallback options for unclear inputs
- Design for success, but plan for failure
- Human handoff should be seamless, not frustrating

**Show Example:** Demonstrate good vs. poor chatbot interactions

**Minutes 5-20: Flow Development**
**Coaching Focus Areas:**
- **Use Case Selection:** Help teams pick 2-3 realistic, high-impact scenarios
- **Conversation Logic:** Ensure flows handle multiple user input variations
- **Business Logic:** Connect conversation paths to business rules
- **User Experience:** Keep interactions efficient but helpful

**Team Visit Strategy:**
- Spend 3-4 minutes with each team
- Ask them to walk through their flow as if you're a customer
- Challenge unrealistic assumptions about user behavior
- Help them identify missing decision points

**Minutes 20-30: Flow Testing & Refinement**
**Peer Testing Activity:**
- Teams pair up and test each other's flows
- One team plays customer, other runs through their flow
- Identify gaps, confusion points, and improvement opportunities
- Document refinements needed

**Quality Indicators:**
- Flows handle multiple ways users might express the same need
- Clear decision points with logical next steps  
- Appropriate handoff triggers to human agents
- Fallback responses that keep conversation moving
- Business rules properly reflected in conversation logic

#### Common Issues & Solutions:
**Issue:** Flows that are too linear/rigid
**Solution:** Help teams add branching and options

**Issue:** Too many questions before providing value
**Solution:** Front-load helpful information, ask details later

**Issue:** No clear success/completion states
**Solution:** Define what successful resolution looks like

### Activity 9: Rapid Prototype Development (25 minutes)

#### High-Energy Implementation Phase
