# AI as Ally: MSBA Customer Service Chatbot Workshop

A comprehensive, hands-on workshop that teaches MSBA students how to collaborate with AI for strategic business problem-solving. Using a real customer service automation case study from Apogee Digital (professional audio equipment), students learn to leverage AI throughout the entire consulting process - from initial research to prototype development.

## üéØ Workshop Overview

**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Format:** Interactive team-based learning with AI collaboration  
**Outcome:** Working customer service chatbot prototype and strategic implementation plan  
**Level:** Business strategy focus with practical AI collaboration skills
**Case Study:** Apogee Digital customer service automation for professional audio equipment company

### üéì Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will:
- **Master AI-assisted business research** for rapid domain expertise and competitive analysis
- **Develop strategic discovery frameworks** for uncovering client requirements and pain points
- **Create technical solution architectures** with AI collaboration for complex business problems
- **Build working prototypes** using no-code platforms and AI-powered design tools
- **Present business solutions** with clear value propositions and implementation roadmaps
- **Understand AI collaboration best practices** for professional consulting engagements

### üß† Core AI Collaboration Principle

**AI as Thought Partner:** The most powerful AI collaboration happens when we use AI to clarify and refine our own thinking. AI can't read our mind - the quality of our outputs depends on how clearly we communicate our context, constraints, and objectives. AI augments human intelligence rather than replacing it. This workshop teaches you to use AI as an intelligent collaborator that helps you think more strategically, not as a tool that thinks for you.

## üöÄ Proof of Concept: From Email to Prototype in 3 Hours

This workshop methodology has been proven in practice. Using these exact AI collaboration techniques, we successfully went from:

**üìß Initial Email Snippet** ‚Üí **ü§ù Discovery Call** ‚Üí **üíª Working Prototype** 

**Result:** [Live Apogee Digital Customer Service Chatbot](https://lontok-apogee-test-01-run-chatbot-dahjsc.streamlit.app/)

This demonstrates the power of structured AI collaboration for rapid business problem-solving. Students will learn the proven framework that makes this level of efficiency possible in professional consulting contexts.
