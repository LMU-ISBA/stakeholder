- **Prepare comprehensive PRD foundations** with validated stakeholder insights organized by template sections

### 🧠 Core AI Collaboration Principle

**AI as Thought Partner:** The most powerful AI collaboration happens when we use AI to clarify and refine our own thinking. AI can't read our mind - the quality of our outputs depends on how clearly we communicate our context, constraints, and objectives. AI augments human intelligence rather than replacing it. This workshop teaches you to use AI as an intelligent collaborator that helps you think more strategically, not as a tool that thinks for you.

## 🚀 Workshop Methodology: Stakeholder-Centered Learning

This workshop teaches the foundational skills for effective stakeholder engagement that leads to successful product development. Students learn to:

**📧 Research Context** → **🎯 Design Interviews** → **🤝 Conduct Conversations** → **📊 Analyze Insights** → **📋 Prepare PRD**

**Key Innovation:** Students master the complete stakeholder engagement lifecycle using AI as a strategic thought partner throughout the process.
